# Pineappl for Myra

An introduction to programming in the modern, post-AI world. 
This is a collection psuedo prompt-coding based exercises inspired by [Code.org](https://code.org/en-US)

# Levels Plan (working)

1. Hungry for Pineapples (Sequencing)
  1. Breakfast - Morning walk (sequencing input)
  2. Lunch - Debugging friends (debugging input)
  3. Musical Pineapples - Make music (sync vs async execution)
  4. Pineapple print - Make art (pattern walk without loops)

2. Keeping up with the Pineapples (Sprites)
  1. Tables - storing information (creating tables)
  2. Maintainence - updating information (modeling data relationships) 
  3. Mini project - creating a google sheet

3. Pineapple Protocol (Events)
  1. Greeting delegation - following instructions (look for events)
  2. Mini project - Pineapple protocol google sheet
  3. Substitute robot - automation (agentic automation)
  4. Birthday wishes - scheduling events (environment variables, scheduling)

4. Extra Hungry for Pineapples (Loops)
  1. Breakfast - Morning walk (input with loops)
  2. Pineapple print - Make art fast (pattern walk with loops)
  3. Double trouble - More pineapples (nested loops)
  4. Pineapple print 2 - Complex patterns (pattern walk with nested loops)

5. A Few Good Pineapples (Conditionals)
  1. Avoiding - avoid bad pineapples (conditional logic)
  2. Sorting - fixing bad pineapples (conditional ladder logic)
  3. Pineapple farm - growing pineapples (conditions and loops)
  4. Pineapple farm robot - automate growing pineapples (agentic conditions and loops)
  5. Shipping pineapples - fulfill orders
  6. Farm handover - automate farm management

6. SUPER PROJECT: Functinally A Pineapple (Functions) 
  1. Farm takeover - functionalize farm management (creating functions)
  2. Enable functions in Google sheet 
  3. Farm tracking dashboard - call functions on/from google sheet

7. Pineapple Maths (Variables)
  1. Bag pack - storing items (basic variables)
  2. Counting pineapples - variable counter (math with variables)
  3. Pineapple print 3 - Variable patterns (pattern walk with variables)
  4. Upgrading pineapple farm - upgrading with variable logic

8. Pineappl a Day (For loops)
  1. Pineapple print 4 - For loop patterns (pattern walk with for loops)
  2. Farm takeover - functions, variables and for loops

9. End project - Email server + birthday wishes
